# Trans-Safe Healthcare Directory

## Description:
This app is a handy way to keep track of safe healthcare providers for transgender patients.
Using it, people can add providers, and leave comments and reviews on them, in a semi-anonymous system.

Based on only usernames and passwords, an account can be creted without a link to any real-life information.  

Additionally, when viewing the site without an account, you will only be able to read existing provider names and locations; no reviews or comments are visible.

This allows user to feel comfortable to be honest in expressing their opinions!
